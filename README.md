# Smart Gambling: A simple Dapp that allows a user to bet on a random number and win/lose ETH. 

# **[Play](https://fintechcamp.github.io/SmartGambling)**

**Project #3**: This decentralized application (Dapp) allows a user to bet on a dice roll and win 5x his bet in ETH. The frontend is programmed using HTML, JavaScript as well as the [Web3.js - Ethereum JavaScript API](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/). The smart contract is programmed in [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) and is designed to run on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blochchain.  

## Deployed on Rinkeby Testnet  

You can play the app using this [link](https://fintechcamp.github.io/SmartGambling/). The contract has only been deployed on GitHub and on the [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/) testnet.

## Smart Contract programmed in Solidity

**Smart Contract Code:** [contracts/SmartGambling.sol](contracts/SmartGambling.sol)

## Front programmed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript  

We used [Web3.js - Ethereum JavaScript API](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to be able to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.  

**JavaScript Code:** [js/main.js](js/main.js)  

## The randomness in the game is powered by the decentralized Oracle [ChainLink](https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf).

## Metamask  

We are using Metamask to authenticate the user and connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
